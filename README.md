The goal of this project is to evaluate pricing, demand, and host activity trends to help a travel startup decide whether to expand services by analysing Airbnb data in Asheville, NC. 

listings.csv → details about each listing (location, host, room type, price, availability).

neighbourhoods.csv → neighborhood codes for listings.

reviews.csv → historical review activity by listing.
